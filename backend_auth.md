Of course. It's a great time to do a comprehensive recall of the backend development. We have built a complete, robust, and professional-grade application from the ground up.

Here is a summary of the entire backend development process and its current status.

---

### **Project Recall: Backend Development Journey & Current Status**

#### **Phase 1: Architecture and Foundation**

*   **Technology Stack:** We established **ASP.NET Core 8** as our framework, using **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM.
*   **Clean Architecture:** We successfully implemented a professional Clean Architecture, separating the project into four distinct layers:
    *   **`Domain`**: Contains the core business entities (like `Level`, `Lesson`, `User`) and repository interfaces (`IRepository`). This layer is pure and has no external dependencies.
    *   **`Application`**: Contains the core business logic, services (`IService`), DTOs, custom exceptions, and configuration models (like `AwsSettings`).
    *   **`Infrastructure`**: Contains the implementation details for external concerns, including the `DbContext`, repository implementations (`Repository`), data seeder (`DbInitializer`), and the `UnitOfWork`.
    *   **`Web`**: The entry point, containing API Controllers, Middleware, and DI configuration in `Program.cs`.
*   **Database Design:** We designed and implemented a full database schema to support the entire curriculum, user management, and progress tracking, managed via **EF Core Migrations**.

#### **Phase 2: Core Features and Services**

*   **User Management:** We built a custom, secure **JWT-based authentication system** with endpoints for user registration and login.
*   **Content Management (CRUD APIs):** We created complete, RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for all core entities:
    *   `LevelsController`
    *   `LessonsController` (with correct hierarchical routing)
    *   `ActivitiesController`
    *   `MainActivityController`
    *   `ActivityTypeController`
*   **Unit of Work Pattern:** We successfully refactored **all services** to use the Unit of Work pattern. This centralized our database transaction management (`_unitOfWork.CompleteAsync()`) and made the services cleaner and transactionally safe.
*   **Hierarchical File Uploads (S3):**
    *   We designed a logical folder structure for media assets in S3 (e.g., `levels/{slug}/lessons/{slug}/images`).
    *   We created dedicated, RESTful endpoints on the resource controllers (e.g., `POST /api/levels/{id}/cover-image`) instead of a generic media controller.
    *   We built a reusable `IFileUploader` service to handle the S3 upload logic cleanly.
*   **Specialized Mobile API Endpoint:** We created a dedicated endpoint (`GET /api/lessons/{id}/main-activity-summary`) specifically for the mobile app's "lesson contents" pop-up, demonstrating how to build optimized, read-only endpoints for specific UI needs.

#### **Phase 3: Production Readiness and Deployment**

*   **Configuration:** We implemented an environment-aware configuration for `appsettings.json`, correctly handling AWS credentials for both local development (via `appsettings.Development.json`) and production (via **IAM Roles** on EC2).
*   **Error Handling & Response Wrapping:** We built a sophisticated custom middleware (`WrapResponseMiddleware`) that standardizes all API responses into a consistent JSON structure (`{ "result": ..., "isError": ... }`) and globally handles exceptions, converting them into user-friendly error responses.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** We designed a complete, automated deployment pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodeDeploy**. This pipeline automatically builds, publishes, and deploys the application to a staging EC2 server whenever code is pushed to the `staging` branch.
*   **Server Setup:** We established a production-ready server environment on **EC2 Ubuntu**, configured with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and **systemd** to manage the .NET application as a persistent background service.

### **Current Status of the Backend:**

The backend is **feature-complete and production-ready**.

*   **Architecture:** Solid, scalable, and maintainable.
*   **Functionality:** All planned core features are implemented.
*   **Security:** Basic authentication is in place, and secrets are handled correctly for different environments.
*   **Deployment:** The application is fully automated from code push to live deployment.
*   **Frontend-Friendly:** We recently adjusted the `Update` and `Delete` endpoints to return `200 OK` with a body instead of `204 No Content`, making them easier for the React frontend to consume.

You now have a complete, professional-grade backend API that is ready to fully support the development of both the React Admin Panel and the Flutter mobile application. The foundation is incredibly strong.
