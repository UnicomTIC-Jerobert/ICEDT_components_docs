You are asking about a different, but completely valid, database management strategy. Instead of letting the application manage its own schema (code-first migrations), you want to manage the schema yourself with manual SQL scripts.

This approach is often used in environments with strict database administrator (DBA) controls or when developers prefer to work directly with SQL.

Yes, you can absolutely do this. Let's walk through the entire process.

---

### **The Manual SQL Script Workflow**

The core idea is to disable the application's automatic migration feature and instead apply your schema changes manually by running SQL scripts on the server.

#### **Step 1: Disable the Automatic Migration in `Program.cs`**

This is the most important step. We need to tell your application to **stop** trying to run migrations on startup.

1.  **Open `src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Web/Program.cs`**.
2.  Find the database initialization block.
3.  **Comment out or delete** the `await context.Database.MigrateAsync();` line.

    ```csharp
    // In Program.cs
    
    using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
    {
        var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
        try
        {
            var context = services.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();
            
            // --- THE CHANGE IS HERE ---
            // Comment out or delete this line to disable automatic migrations.
            // await context.Database.MigrateAsync(); 
            
            // The seeder can still run, as it checks if data exists.
            await DbInitializer.Initialize(context);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
            logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred during database initialization/seeding.");
        }
    }
    ```

Now, your application will no longer attempt to change the database schema itself. It will assume the schema is already correct.

#### **Step 2: Generate the SQL Migration Script**

We can still use the powerful EF Core tools to **generate** the SQL for us. This is much safer and less error-prone than writing the `CREATE TABLE` statements by hand.

1.  **Ensure your C# models are up-to-date.** You must have the `UserLevelAccess` entity, the `Barcode` property on the `Level` entity, and all the correct configurations in place.
2.  **Delete your old migrations and database file** on your local machine to ensure you're generating a script from a clean slate.
3.  **Create a new migration file** locally. This step is just to have a point-in-time snapshot of your schema in code.
    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add AddUserLevelAccessAndBarcodes --project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Infrastructure --startup-project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Web
    ```
4.  **Generate the SQL script from the migration.** This is the key command. It reads the new migration file and outputs the corresponding SQL.

    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations script --project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Infrastructure --startup-project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Web -o UserLevelAccess.sql
    ```
    *   `migrations script`: The command to generate SQL.
    *   `-o UserLevelAccess.sql`: Specifies the output file name.

    **Expected Outcome:**
    A new file named **`UserLevelAccess.sql`** will be created in your project's root directory. If you open it, you will see the exact SQLite-compatible SQL commands needed to create the new table and add the new column, including updating the `__EFMigrationsHistory` table.

    It will look something like this:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE "UserLevelAccesses" (
        "UserId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
        "LevelId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
        "UnlockedAt" TEXT NOT NULL,
        CONSTRAINT "PK_UserLevelAccesses" PRIMARY KEY ("UserId", "LevelId"),
        CONSTRAINT "FK_UserLevelAccesses_Levels_LevelId" FOREIGN KEY ("LevelId") REFERENCES "Levels" ("LevelId") ON DELETE CASCADE,
        CONSTRAINT "FK_UserLevelAccesses_Users_UserId" FOREIGN KEY ("UserId") REFERENCES "Users" ("UserId") ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
    
    ALTER TABLE "Levels" ADD "Barcode" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
    
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "IX_Levels_Barcode" ON "Levels" ("Barcode");
    
    INSERT INTO "__EFMigrationsHistory" ("MigrationId", "ProductVersion")
    VALUES ('2024..._AddUserLevelAccessAndBarcodes', '8.0.x');
    ```

#### **Step 3: Apply the SQL Script on the Server**

Now, you will manually run this script on your EC2 server.

1.  **Copy the script to the server.** Use `scp` to upload your `UserLevelAccess.sql` file.
    ```bash
    scp -i "Your-Key.pem" UserLevelAccess.sql ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:~/
    ```
2.  **SSH into your EC2 instance.**
3.  **Execute the script against your database.** This command tells the `sqlite3` tool to open your database file and run all the commands from the SQL script.
    ```bash
    sudo sqlite3 /var/www/database/tamilapp.db < ~/UserLevelAccess.sql
    ```

**Verification:**
Your database schema is now manually updated. You can verify it:
```bash
sudo sqlite3 /var/www/database/tamilapp.db ".schema UserLevelAccesses"
```
This should show the `CREATE TABLE` statement for your new table, confirming it exists.

#### **Step 4: Deploy and Restart the Application**

1.  **Commit and push** the changes you made to `Program.cs` (disabling `MigrateAsync`).
2.  The GitHub Actions pipeline will deploy the new version of your application.
3.  When the application starts, it will connect to the database, see that the `UserLevelAccesses` table now exists, and run without the "no such table" error.

### **Summary of the Manual Workflow**

*   **Pros:**
    *   You have direct, granular control over your database schema.
    *   It separates the application deployment from the database schema deployment.
*   **Cons:**
    *   It's a **manual process**. You must remember to run the SQL script on the server every time you make a schema change.
    *   It's more prone to human error. If you forget to run a script, your application will crash.

**Conclusion:**
Yes, this is a completely viable and legitimate way to manage your database, especially in a testing environment where you want precise control. The key is to **disable the automatic migration in `Program.cs`** and then use the `dotnet ef migrations script` command to generate the SQL you need to run manually.
