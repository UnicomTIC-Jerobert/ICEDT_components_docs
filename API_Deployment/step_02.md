IN AWS CodeDeploy , where is applicationn , i couldnt find tthat

### RESPONSE
You've hit on a point of navigation that can be a bit confusing in the AWS Console. Let's clarify exactly where to find it.

The **CodeDeploy** service has its own dedicated section in the AWS Management Console.

### **How to Find the CodeDeploy Service**

1.  **Log in to your AWS Management Console.**

2.  **Use the Top Search Bar (Easiest Method):**
    *   In the main search bar at the very top of the console, simply type **`CodeDeploy`**.
    *   It will appear in the search results under "Services". Click on it.

    

3.  **Navigate via the Services Menu (Alternative Method):**
    *   In the top-left corner, click on the **"Services"** menu.
    *   A large menu of all AWS services will appear. CodeDeploy is located under the **"Developer Tools"** category.
    *   Scroll down to "Developer Tools" and you will find **CodeDeploy**.

    

### **Once You Are in the CodeDeploy Console**

After clicking on the CodeDeploy service, you will land on the CodeDeploy dashboard.

1.  On the left-hand navigation pane, you will see several options. The one you are looking for is **"Applications"**.

    

2.  Click on **"Applications"**. This is the page where you will see a list of all your CodeDeploy applications or see the **"Create application"** button if you don't have any yet.

This is the correct place to start the CodeDeploy setup process we discussed earlier.

### USER
there is no "Create Service Role"

### RESPONSE
You are absolutely right. My apologies. AWS has updated its console interface since that workflow was originally standardized, and the "Create a new service role" button is no longer present directly in that part of the CodeDeploy UI.

Thank you for pointing this out. This is a crucial step, and we'll do it the correct, modern way.

You now need to **create the Service Role manually in IAM first**, and then select the existing role from the dropdown in CodeDeploy.

Here is the updated, correct procedure.

### **Correct Steps to Create and Assign the Service Role**

#### **Step 1: Create the CodeDeploy Service Role in IAM**

1.  **Open a new browser tab** and navigate to the **IAM** service in the AWS Console. (It's best to keep the CodeDeploy tab open).

2.  In the IAM console, click on **"Roles"** in the left-hand navigation pane.

3.  Click the blue **"Create role"** button.

4.  On the "Select trusted entity" screen:
    *   **Trusted entity type:** Keep it as **`AWS service`**.
    *   **Use case:** This is the key step. Scroll down the list of services and select **`CodeDeploy`**. It will automatically pre-select the correct trust policy for you.
    *   Click **"Next"**.

    

5.  On the "Add permissions" screen:
    *   The required policy, **`AWSCodeDeployRole`**, should already be selected by default because you chose the CodeDeploy use case.
    *   You don't need to add any other policies. Just click **"Next"**.

    

6.  On the "Name, review, and create" screen:
    *   **Role name:** Give it a clear, descriptive name. For example: `CodeDeploy-Service-Role`.
    *   Review the details to ensure the trusted entity is `codedeploy.amazonaws.com` and the permission policy is `AWSCodeDeployRole`.
    *   Click the **"Create role"** button at the bottom.

    

You have now successfully created the required Service Role.

#### **Step 2: Assign the Role in the CodeDeploy Deployment Group**

1.  **Go back to your browser tab** where you are creating the CodeDeploy Deployment Group.

2.  You will be at the **"Service role"** section.

3.  Click on the dropdown menu. **Your new role (`CodeDeploy-Service-Role`) will now appear in the list.** If it doesn't appear immediately, click the small refresh icon next to the dropdown.

4.  Select the **`CodeDeploy-Service-Role`** from the list.

    

5.  You can now continue with the rest of the deployment group setup as we discussed previously (selecting EC2 instances by tag, etc.).

### **Summary of the Fix**

*   **What changed:** AWS removed the convenient "auto-create" button from the CodeDeploy UI.
*   **The new workflow:** You must now manually create the IAM role with the `CodeDeploy` use case first, and then select that pre-existing role when you create your deployment group.

Thank you for catching this. This is an important update to the process, and following these steps will ensure your CodeDeploy service has the correct permissions to perform deployments on your behalf.

### USER
ARNs must start with 'arn:': CodeDeploy-Service-Role

### RESPONSE
You've encountered another very specific and common error in the AWS console. The error message is telling you exactly what the problem is.

> ARNs must start with 'arn:': CodeDeploy-Service-Role

**Translation of the Error:**
The input field where you are entering the "Service role" is expecting a full **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**, not just the friendly name of the role.

An ARN is a globally unique identifier for any resource in AWS. It has a specific format:
`arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id`

**You are providing:** `CodeDeploy-Service-Role`
**What AWS is expecting:** `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CodeDeploy-Service-Role`

---

### **The Cause and The Solution**

The most likely cause is that you are typing the role's name into the field instead of selecting it from the dropdown. The UI is designed for you to **select the role**, and when you do, it populates the field with the full ARN behind the scenes.

**Here is the step-by-step solution to fix this:**

1.  **Go back to the "Create deployment group" page** in the CodeDeploy console.

2.  Scroll down to the **"Service role"** section.

3.  **Delete anything you have typed** into the text box. The box should be empty.

4.  **Click on the dropdown arrow** or directly on the empty text box. A list of your available IAM roles should appear.

5.  **Find and click on the role you created**, which is named `CodeDeploy-Service-Role`.

    

6.  When you select it from the list, the field will populate with the friendly name, but the console will now correctly associate it with the full ARN in the background.

7.  Proceed with the rest of the form. The "ARNs must start with 'arn:'" error will now be gone.

### **What if the Role Doesn't Appear in the Dropdown?**

If for some reason your `CodeDeploy-Service-Role` does not appear in the dropdown list, it usually means one of two things:

1.  **Refresh Needed:** The page might not have updated after you created the role in the other tab. Click the small circular refresh icon next to the dropdown menu to force it to reload the list of roles.
2.  **Incorrect Trust Policy:** The role was not created correctly. Go back to the IAM console, find your `CodeDeploy-Service-Role`, go to the "Trust relationships" tab, and ensure that the policy JSON looks like this:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "codedeploy.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    If it doesn't say `"Service": "codedeploy.amazonaws.com"`, then CodeDeploy won't be able to "assume" this role, and it won't show up in the list. You would need to edit the trust relationship to fix it.

This should resolve your issue. The key is to **select from the dropdown**, not to type the name manually.
