This is an excellent and very important question that deals with app store management, branding, and technical migration. Handling this correctly is crucial for a smooth launch.

Since you have access to the client's existing Google Play Store listing, you have two primary strategies. **Strategy B is strongly recommended.**

---

### **Understanding the Situation**

*   **You Have:** A brand new, scratch-built application (`.aab` file).
*   **They Have:** An existing, published (or unpublished) app listing in the Google Play Console for the same conceptual application.
*   **The Goal:** Replace their old, discontinued app with your new, modern one.

---

### **Strategy A: Publish a Completely New App**

In this approach, you would create a brand new, separate app listing in their Play Console.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Log in to the Google Play Console.
    2.  Click "Create app".
    3.  You would have to choose a **new Package Name** (also called Application ID). For example, if the old one was `com.client.tamilapp`, yours would have to be something different, like `com.client.tamilapp.new`. This is a permanent, unique identifier.
    4.  You would fill out the entire store listing from scratch: name, description, screenshots, privacy policy, etc.
    5.  You would then unpublish their old app.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Clean Slate:** You have full control and no legacy constraints.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Loses All History:** You lose any existing user base, ratings, reviews, and download statistics associated with the old app. Users of the old app will **not** get an automatic update. They would have to find and install your new app manually.
    *   **Brand Confusion:** Having two similar-looking apps (one old, one new) can confuse users.
    *   **Package Name Change:** The package name is part of the app's identity and is used in things like deep links. Changing it can be disruptive.

**Verdict on Strategy A:** **Do not do this.** It's a bad user experience and throws away any brand equity the old app might have had.

---

### **Strategy B: Update the Existing App Listing (Highly Recommended)**

This is the standard and correct way to handle a complete rewrite. You will be treating your new app as a **major version update** to the existing one.

*   **Process:**
    1.  You will use the **same Package Name** (`com.client.tamilapp`) as the old app.
    2.  You will use the **same Keystore (signing key)** that was used to sign the old app. **This is the most critical technical requirement.**
    3.  You will upload your new app's `.aab` file as a new release to the *existing* app listing.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide for Strategy B**

**Step 1: Obtain the Original Keystore (Signing Key)**

This is the most important step. **Google Play will reject any update that is not signed with the exact same key as the previous version.** This is a security measure to prevent app hijacking.

*   **What you need:** You need the **`.keystore` or `.jks`** file from the original developers. You will also need the **keystore password**, the **key alias**, and the **key password** associated with it.
*   **Action:** You must ask your client to retrieve these from their previous developers. There is no way around this. If the key is lost, you cannot update the app and will be forced to use Strategy A. Explain to your client that this is a mandatory security requirement from Google.

**Step 2: Configure Your Expo App to Use the Existing Package Name**

1.  Ask your client for the **Package Name** (Application ID) of the existing app. You can find this in the Play Console URL for the app or in its dashboard. It will look like `com.yourclient.appname`.
2.  Open your Expo project's `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.
3.  Set the `android.package` property to this exact name.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "Your App Name",
        // ...
        "android": {
          "package": "com.yourclient.appname" // Use the EXACT existing package name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

**Step 3: Configure Your Build to Use the Original Keystore**

You need to tell the Expo build system (EAS Build) or your local Gradle build where to find the old keystore and what its credentials are.

**If using EAS Build (Recommended for Expo):**
1.  Run the command `eas credentials`.
2.  It will guide you through the process. When it asks how you want to handle the Android Keystore, choose the option to **"Use my own keystore"** or "Import an existing keystore".
3.  It will then prompt you for the path to the `.keystore` file and ask you to enter the **keystore password**, **key alias**, and **key password**.
4.  EAS will securely upload this information to your Expo account so it can be used during the build process.

**If building locally (`gradlew assembleRelease`):**
1.  Place the `.keystore` file in the `android/app` directory of your project.
2.  Create or edit the `android/gradle.properties` file and add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with the real credentials.
    ```properties
    MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=your_keystore_name.keystore
    MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your_key_alias
    MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
    MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
    ```
    **Security Warning:** Do not commit this `gradle.properties` file with real passwords to a public repository.

**Step 4: Update the Version Code**

Every new release you upload to Google Play must have a higher `versionCode` than the previous one.
1.  Find out what the `versionCode` of the last release was in the Play Console.
2.  In your `app.json` or `app.config.js`, set your `android.versionCode` to a higher number.
    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        // ...
        "version": "2.0.0", // This is the user-facing version name
        "android": {
          "versionCode": 15 // If the old app was 14, this must be 15 or higher
        }
      }
    }
    ```

**Step 5: Build and Upload**

1.  Build your release app (`.aab` file) using either `eas build -p android` or `npx expo prebuild && cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease`.
2.  Log in to the Google Play Console.
3.  Navigate to the existing app.
4.  Go to the **"Production"** track (or start with "Internal testing").
5.  Click **"Create new release"**.
6.  Upload your new `.aab` file. Google Play will verify that the package name matches and that it's signed with the correct key.
7.  Update the "What's new in this version?" release notes. This is a great place to announce the completely rebuilt app.
8.  Submit the release for review.

### **Conclusion and Client Communication**

**Your recommendation to the client should be:**

> "The best and standard approach is to publish our new application as a major update to your existing Play Store listing. This will ensure all your existing users receive the new app as a simple update, and we will retain all the history, ratings, and reviews.
>
> To do this, there is one critical technical requirement from Google: we must use the original digital signing key (the `.keystore` file and its passwords) that was used for the old app. Could you please retrieve this from your previous development team? Once we have that key, the process will be straightforward."
